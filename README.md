# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My Name is [Chris](http://chris-pezza.com), but you can call me [Chiefpansancolt](http://chiefpansancolt.live)

<samp>
I am a developer of Ruby on Rails and Salesforce. 

You can find my projects I have worked on my website or check out my persona website where I stream and make additional content on.

Outside of development I stream and play video games on Twitch.tv/chiefpansancolt or spend time with my beautiful wife and daughter.

You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chiefpansancolt).

Hope you enjoyed and Thanks for stopping by!
